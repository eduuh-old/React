## using a Build WorkFlow => Using local coding Environment
### Why
> Recommended for Spa and mpas
- optimize code (we want our code to be small as possible)
- Use Next-gen Javascript Features. ES6 vs ES5
- Be More productive (css auto prefixes)=> this will be done automaticall .Linting is a good feature.

## How (We will use some Defactor stardard)
- Use Dependency management tool npm or yarn    => will use **npm**
- Use Builder - Recommended: webpack
- Use compiler (next-gen javascript) Babel + presents.
- Use a development Server => Will help us to see our app as it will be in production tool.

## ReactTools
## Get Started Immediately
You don’t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.
Just create a project, and you’re good to go.
- use the command to install the tool.
```bash
npm install create-react-app
```
To create a react application. You simply use the command.
```bash
create-react-app <name _of_the_app> --script-version 1.1.5
```

## --script-version 1.1.5 
-  This flag does not affect the version of React you will be using but. It affect the **directory structure** of the react_app.

use npm start run => to open the development server.
